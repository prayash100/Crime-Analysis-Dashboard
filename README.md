# Crime Data Analysis and Visualization

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing and visualizing a large crime dataset with around 1 million data points. The goal is to provide insights and trends that can help law enforcement and policymakers make data-driven decisions. The dataset was cleaned using Python (in Jupyter Notebook), and the visualizations were created using Tableau. Finally, an interactive dashboard was built to allow users to explore the data and draw conclusions.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Extensive data cleaning and preprocessing were performed using Python (Pandas, NumPy).
- **Visualization**: Tableau was used to create insightful and interactive visualizations.
- **Dashboard**: A Tableau dashboard was built to allow easy exploration of crime patterns and trends.
- 
## Dataset
The dataset consists of around 1 million crime records, including information such as:
- Date and time of the crime
- Crime type
- Location details
- Weapon used
- Victim and suspect demographics

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data cleaning and preprocessing.
  - Jupyter Notebook as the IDE for running the code.
  - Libraries: Pandas, NumPy
- **Tableau**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- 
## Process
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Loaded the dataset in Jupyter Notebook using Pandas.
   - Cleaned missing values, removed duplicates, and performed feature engineering.
   - Extracted useful information from date columns (e.g., year, month).
   - Exported the cleaned data to a CSV file.

2. **Data Visualization**:
   - Imported the cleaned data into Tableau.
   - Created various visualizations like bar charts, pie charts, and line charts to understand crime patterns, trends, and outliers.
   - Focused on visualizing:
     - Crime type distribution.
     - Yearly/monthly trends in crime occurrences.
     - Crime location and demographic analysis.
   
3. **Dashboard Creation**:
   - Built an interactive Tableau dashboard, providing:
     - A high-level overview of crime trends.
     - The ability to drill down into specific crime types, locations, and time periods.
 
## **Conclusion**

This project showcases how crime data can be effectively analyzed and visualized to gain actionable insights. The Tableau dashboard provides a user-friendly way to explore crime trends, which can be useful for law enforcement agencies, policymakers, and researchers.
